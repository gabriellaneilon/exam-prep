<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf.
# These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

# Lets load in example data, and see how this can be stored and later called from your 'data' folder.
if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
Example_data <- Texevier::Ex_Dat

# Notice that as you are working in a .Rproj file (I am assuming you are) - the relative paths of your directories start at your specified root.
# This means that when working in a .Rproj file, you never need to use getwd() - it is assumed as your base root automatically.

# Introduction \label{Introduction}

References are to be made as follows: @fama1997[p. 33] and @grinold2000 Such authors could also be referenced in brackets [@grinold2000] and together [@fama1997 \& @grinold2000]. Source the reference code from scholar.google.com by clicking on ``cite'' below article name. Then select BibTeX at the bottom of the Cite window, and proceed to copy and paste this code into your ref.bib file, located in the directory's Tex folder. Open this file in Rstudio for ease of management, else open it in your preferred Tex environment. Add and manage your article details here for simplicity - once saved, it will self-adjust in your paper.

> I suggest renaming the top line after \@article, as done in the template ref.bib file, to something more intuitive for you to remember. Do not change the rest of the code. Also, be mindful of the fact that bib references from google scholar may at times be incorrect. Reference Latex forums for correct bibtex notation.

To reference a section, you have to set a label using ``\\label'' in R, and then reference it in-text as e.g. referencing a later section, Section \ref{Meth}.

Writing in Rmarkdown is surprizingly easy - see [this website](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) cheatsheet for a summary on writing Rmd writing tips.

# Data  {-}

Notice how I used the curly brackets and dash to remove the numbering of the data section.

Discussion of data should be thorough with a table of statistics and ideally a figure.

In your tempalte folder, you will find a Data and a Code folder. In order to keep your data files neat, store all of them in your Data folder. Also, I strongly suggest keeping this Rmd file for writing and executing commands, not writing out long pieces of data-wrangling. In the example below, I simply create a ggplot template for scatter plot consistency. I suggest keeping all your data in a data folder.

<!-- The following is a code chunk. It must have its own unique name (after the r), or no name. After the comma follows commands for R which are self-explanatory. By default, the code and messages will not be printed in your pdf, just the output: -->

```{r Figure1,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Caption Here \\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}

  

```

To make your graphs look extra nice in latex world, you could use Tikz device. Replace dev - 'png' with 'tikz' in the chunk below. Notice this makes the build time longer and produces extra tex files - so if you are comfortable with this, set your device to Tikz and try it out:

```{r Figure2, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Caption Here \\label{Figure2}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}

library(patchwork)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

To reference the plot above, add a ``\\label'' after the caption in the chunk heading, as done above. Then reference the plot as such: As can be seen, Figures \ref{Figure1}  and \ref{Figure2} are excellent, with Figure \ref{Figure2} being particularly aesthetically pleasing due to its device setting of Tikz. The nice thing now is that it correctly numbers all your figures (and sections or tables) and will update if it moves. The links are also dynamic.

I very strongly suggest using ggplot2 (ideally in combination with dplyr) using the ggtheme package to change the themes of your figures.

Also note the information that I have placed above the chunks in the code chunks for the figures. You can edit any of these easily - visit the Rmarkdown webpage for more information.

# Splitting a page

You can also very easily split a page using built-in Pandoc formatting. I comment this out in the code (as this has caused issues building the pdf for some users - which I presume to be a Pandoc issue), but you are welcome to try it out yourself by commenting out the following section in your Rmd file.


<!-- :::::: {.columns data-latex="[T]"} -->
<!-- ::: {.column data-latex="{0.7\textwidth}"} -->
<!-- ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4} -->
<!-- par(mar = c(4, 4, .2, .1)) -->
<!-- plot(cars, pch = 19) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ::: -->
<!-- ::: {.column data-latex="{0.05\textwidth}"} -->
<!-- \ -->
<!-- ::: -->
<!-- ::: {.column data-latex="{0.2\textwidth}"} -->
<!-- \scriptsize -->
